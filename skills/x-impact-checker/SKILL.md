## Score Normalization

The algorithm applies normalization to balance positive and negative signals:

```
Final Score = Base Score (0-100) + Penalties (-75 to 0)
Normalized Score = max(0, min(100, Final Score))
```

**Penalty Capping:**
- Total penalties ≤ -20: Applied at full weight
- Total penalties > -20: Gradual dampening begins
- Total penalties > -75: Hard cap at -75 to prevent over-penalization

This prevents a single negative signal from completely dominating the score while maintaining their importance in the algorithm.

## Text Analysis Limitations

This skill performs heuristic text-based analysis, not ML prediction.

### What This Skill Cannot Detect

**Missing Metadata:**
- Actual media presence (photos, videos)
- Real video duration or quality
- Actual click-through rates
- True engagement metrics
- Author reputation/follower count
- Tweet timestamps or virality history

**Cannot Access:**
- Phoenix ML model predictions
- User interaction history
- Network graph relationships
- Real-time engagement signals

### What This Skill Infers From

**Text-Based Heuristics:**
- Language patterns and structure
- Content formatting (threads, lists, etc.)
- Emotional tone and style
- Visual indicators (emojis, markdown)
- Call-to-action strength
- Question vs. statement structure

**Scoring Approach:**
- **Conservative**: Unknown elements get baseline scores
- **Pattern-Based**: Detects language cues (e.g., 📸 for photos, 🧵 for threads)
- **Optimization-Focused**: Best used for pre-publishing content improvement

### Best Use Case

Pre-publishing optimization to maximize engagement potential, not post-hoc analytics or prediction of actual engagement numbers.

---

## Language Handling

Detect input language. Respond in same language. Keep optimized version in original language.

### Bilingual Display for Category and Factor Names

**When input is in Japanese:**
- Display Category and Factor names as: `日本語訳（English Original）`
- Examples:
  - Category: `コアエンゲージメント（Core Engagement）`
  - Factor: `返信潜在力（Reply Potential）`
  - Factor: `リツイート潜在力（Retweet Potential）`

**When input is in English:**
- Display Category and Factor names in English only
- Examples:
  - Category: `Core Engagement`
  - Factor: `Reply Potential`

**Japanese translations with emojis for reference:**
